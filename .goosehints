## Development Workflow
- Always ask for permission before staging, committing, or pushing git changes
- User prefers to control git operations manually
- It's okay to ask if changes should be staged/committed/pushed
- After successful artefact build, copy apk to ~/ProtonDrive/ and overwrite any existing "app-debug.apk" file (NEVER delete or overwrite another file within the protondrive folder!)
